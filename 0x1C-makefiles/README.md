# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## SYNOPSIS

The make utility in Ubuntu (and other Unix-like operating systems) is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of compiling and building executable programs from source code. It reads a file called "Makefile" that contains rules and dependencies for building the software.

A Makefile typically includes:

Target rules: These are the desired output files or actions. Each rule specifies a target, dependencies, and the commands to be executed to build the target.

Dependencies: Files or actions that the target depends on. If any of the dependencies are modified, the target needs to be rebuilt.

Commands: The shell commands to be executed to build the target. These commands are usually written in Bash or another shell scripting language.
